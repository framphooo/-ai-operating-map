# Security Policy

## Reporting a Vulnerability
- Do not post security details in public issues or discussions.
- Once the GitHub repo is live, use **Security → Private vulnerability report** to notify the maintainers.
- If private reporting is unavailable, open a minimal issue titled `[security]` and request a private channel; share details only after we respond.

## Response
- We aim to acknowledge new reports within 3 business days and provide an initial assessment shortly after.
